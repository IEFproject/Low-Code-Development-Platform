## Rintagi Low-Code-Development-Platform

The world’s first open-source low-code development platform for mission-critical applications. Build beautiful, responsive mission-critical database systems and limitless enterprise-grade applications with our patented futureproof platform. 

Most enterprise software applications today are hand-crafted and hand-coded. This process is slow, expensive and can result in inconsistencies. Moreover, it is a considerable challenge to keep up with ever-changing technologies. 

Rintagi automates the software development process of a business saving on valuable resources. With simple visual drag-and-drop interfaces, Rintagi allows both business analysts and developers to design, develop, deploy and rejuvenate mission-critical applications with speed, ease, and performance. 

Applications can be extended without any restrictions by adding unique business rules. The unique architecture of Rintagi allows it to rejuvenate the applications it builds while rejuvenating itself. The platform requires low maintenance and adapts easily to changing technology and business requirements.
